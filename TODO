jump to location via minimap
combat alerts via minimap
fog of war
balloon collection animation
checksum resources & prototypes
send map data, resources & prototypes over the network
save/load game state (and drop-in/drop-out multiplayer)
make pathfinding take buildings into account
improve unit steering behaviour to avoid other units/buildings
fix ground units getting stuck in unreachable areas
[scgtrp] do something else with the map edges (i couldn't find the wyvern until it was too late because it got hidden behind the wall)
dynamic terrain deformation, and real-time reachability map updates
westwood controls
unit control groups (UI, n to select, ctrl+n to set group, ctrl+shift+n add to group(?))
unit movement groups (issue command to multiple units and they coordinate)
[???] balance
[???] magic metal
[scgtrp] more tanks!
[scgtrp] i still kind of like the idea of a unit designed for swarming (but less OP than the blue orbs)
[scgtrp] maybe some kind of magic hivemind thing where nearby blue orbs take damage when you hurt one of them?
modular giant robots, like metal fatigue
[scgtrp] maybe have magic focus more on powers (magic shields, temporary invisibility, ???) than combat force
[scgtrp] magic nerfing ideas: magic comes from a magic field around you that regenerates over time, it's possible to temporarily deplete the magic in an area
[scgtrp ???] magic nerfing ideas: magic is actually nerf guns, held by someone hallucinating that nerf guns are actually magic wands
[scgtrp] cockatrice unit. {hitscan attack/gaze slows/stones units}
[scgtrp] exploding runes you can place as traps
[scgtrp] tech: separate fighter/bomber planes, helicopters
ducks are not amphibious. add navmesh layer for amphibious & naval units
amphibious & naval units
[???] magic units constantly drain smoke, things go wrong when smoke runs out. golems fall apart, wyverns go wild, and ducks turn into normal non-lightning ducks
[scgtrp] is there a way to mine from more than one smoke thing at a time?
